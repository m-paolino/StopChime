How often does the startup sound of your Mac bother you? How many times do you forget to silence your Mac before shutting it down, getting caught in awkward quiet moments where you don't want to be noisy?

We understand how frustrating that can be, but no worries! **StopChime** has been made JUST FOR YOU to grant you a better and more peaceful life.

## What is *StopChime*? :point_left:

Putting all technical details aside, **StopChime** automatically silences the boot sound of your  Mac before its shutdown.

NOTE: please find the installation manual below or by simply clicking [here](#installation-steps).

## How does it work? :sunglasses:

The only effective way of disabling the boot sound, without resorting to hacks, is to mute the Mac right before shutting it off. **StopChime** automates this process with a very simple script!
Additionally the script restores the volume settings once you log into your Mac.

So with StopChime you can forget about silencing your Mac, and get rid of the boot sound!
Now you can chill and stop worrying if you are in a classroom, library or any other place where silence is golden! :sweat_smile:

If you want to see more detailed info, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/m-paolino/StopChime/wiki) page.

NOTE: unfortunately it does not work when external speakers are connected (I am working on it!) - see more on [Issues](https://github.com/m-paolino/StopChime/issues).
