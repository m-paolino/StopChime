How often does the startup sound of your Mac bother you? :persevere:
<br>
How many times do you forget to silence your Mac before shutting it down, getting caught in awkward quiet moments where you don't want to be noisy? :weary:

We understand how frustrating that can be, but no worries!

>**StopChime** has been made JUST FOR YOU to grant you a better, more peaceful life. :top:

## So what is *StopChime*? :point_left:

Putting all technical details aside, **StopChime** automatically silences the boot sound of your  Mac before its shutdown.

NOTE: please find the installation manual below or by simply clicking [here](#installation-steps).

<a name="how"></a>
## But how does it work? :sunglasses:

The only effective way of disabling the boot sound, without resorting to hacks, is to mute the Mac right before shutting it off. **StopChime** automates this process with a very simple script!
<br>
Additionally the script restores the volume settings once you log into your Mac.

So with StopChime you can forget about silencing your Mac, and get rid of the boot sound!
<br>
Now you can chill and stop worrying if you are in a classroom, library or any other place where silence is golden! :sweat_smile:

If you want to see more detailed info, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/m-paolino/StopChime/wiki) page.

NOTE: unfortunately it does not work when external speakers are connected (I am working on it!) - see more on [Issues](https://github.com/m-paolino/StopChime/issues).
